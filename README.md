# JPNg35-Data-Science-Coding-Challenge
/* This program uses Venmo payments that stream in to build a graph of users and their relationship with one another. The program calculates the median degree of a vertex in a graph and update this each time a new Venmo payment appears. The median degree is calculated across a 60-second sliding window.

Input: actor
       target
       created-time
Constants: Not Applicable
Output: rolling median degree
